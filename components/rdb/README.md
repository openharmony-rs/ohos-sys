# OpenHarmony relational database bindings

The OpenHarmony relational database (RDB) store manages data based on relational models. 
With the underlying SQLite database, the RDB store provides a complete mechanism for managing local databases.
To satisfy different needs in complicated scenarios, the RDB store offers a series of APIs for performing operations
such as adding, deleting, modifying, and querying data, and supports direct execution of SQL statements.

For more details, see the [official OpenHarmony RDB documentation][rdb-docs].

## 0.1.4 (2025-01-09)

- Added API-13 feature (no changes)

# 0.1.3 (2025-01-04)

## Changes

- Regenerated the bindings with new generator
- `HiTrace_Tracepoint_Type` is now marked as non-exhaustive. This change is not considered breaking,
  since the enum is only passed towards ffi and not received from ffi functions.

## Added

- hitrace API level 12 bindings (beta)

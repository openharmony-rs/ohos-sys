# 0.1.3 (2024-12-26)

## Changes

- Regenerated the bindings with new generator
- `HiTrace_Tracepoint_Type` is now marked as non-exhaustive. This change is not considered breaking,
  since the enum is only passed towards ffi and not received from ffi functions.

# 0.1.2 (2024-09-05)

## Added

- hitrace API level 12 bindings (beta)
